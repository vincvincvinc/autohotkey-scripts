### global obsidian hotkeys

Shortcuts I use to write and search for notes whenever I have my fingers on the keyboard, regardless of which program I am in.

For other windows users of awesome markdown / zettelkasten note app http://obsidian.md

- CtrlAltShift + N 		- Obsidian: fresh new note
- CtrlAltShift + F 		- Obsidian: search all notes
- CtrlAltShift + O 		- Obsidian: open note by name
