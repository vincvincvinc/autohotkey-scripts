Collection of autohotkey scripts I use. Most are hacky mash-ups of self-made and copy-pasted. See http://www.autohotkey.com

Shortcuts I use to write and search for notes whenever I have my fingers on the keyboard, regardless of which program I am in.

CtrlAltShift + N 		- Obsidian: fresh new note
CtrlAltShift + F 		- Obsidian: search all notes
CtrlAltShift + O 		- Obsidian: open note by name
